----------
DESIGN
----------
I decided I would break the problem down and write the program in two phases:
(1) implement the count
(2) implement the sum

----------
PROGRAMMING
----------
I wrote pseudocode and made a skeleton for the program. I then started programming the actual program. I had to revise my program and include 3 labels.

There was some debugging because I was mixing up variables and passing in wrong arguments for the MIPS instructions.

I couldn't figure out how to get a new line to print so I added another data item.

----------
TESTING
----------
I tested by using 2 numbers in the array, then 3 numbers, and then the full set.
