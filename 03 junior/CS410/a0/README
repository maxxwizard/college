=========================
COMPILATION
=========================
All 4 executables (getsections, getsyms, getsections_dl, getsyms_dl)
are automatically compiled via the make tool. Simply browse to the
directory via the command prompt and run the command "make".

=========================
EXECUTION
=========================
Set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to dot (".") or the full
pathname to the directory containing "libobjdata.so". Then the two
dl'ed executables will run.

=========================
CLEANUP
=========================
To clean the directory of all executable, object, and library files,
run a "make cleanall" command. To remove just the object files, run
a "make clean" command.

=========================
TESTING
=========================
A simple Bash script (stats_generation.sh) was run on kanga.bu.edu
to generate the `stats` file.
