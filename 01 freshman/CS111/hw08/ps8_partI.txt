1)

a) This method counts down from a given number, printing each subsequent number on a line.
b) The method prints the number n and then calls itself to print n-1. It does this repeatedly until n finally becomes 0.
c) The base case is when the number is less than or equal to 0.
d) countDown(4):
     System.out.println(4);
     countDown(3):
       System.out.println(3);
       countDown(2):
         System.out.println(2);
         countDown(1):
           System.out.println(1);
           countDown(0):
             return;

2)

a) mystery(1, 8) calls mystery(2, 6)
     mystery(2, 6) calls mystery(3, 4)
       mystery(3, 4) calls mystery(4, 2)
         mystery(4, 2) returns 4
       mystery(3, 4) returns 1+4 or 5
     mystery(2, 6) returns 1+5 or 6
   mystery(1, 8) returns 1+6 or 7
b) 7
c) 4
d) If a was 1 and b was 0, the base case would never be reached because a would keep increasing while b is decreasing. b will therefore never be greater than a.

public static boolean search(int num, int[] arr, int pos) {
    if (pos == arr.length)
        return false;

    if (arr[pos] == num)
        return true;

    return search(num, arr, pos+1);
}
