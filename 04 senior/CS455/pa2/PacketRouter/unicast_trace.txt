#  Programming Assignment #2 
#
#  This is a sample trace containing initialization, link-state packets and
#  unicast routing events which are representative of input to your program. 
#

#  All lines beginning with "#" are comments

#  All events begin with a timestamp in milliseconds.
#  The first event in a trace is an initialization event, which must have
#     timestamp zero, the ID of your processor, and your directly connected 
#     neighbors.

# I denotes initialization event.  You are processor 4325, directly connected
# to nodes with ID's 4214, 4718, and 1203 at distances 6, 9 and 11 respectively.
0  I  4325  <4214, 6>  <4718, 9>  <1203, 11> 


# L denotes link-state packet arrival event.  You have just received an LSP
# from processor 4214 with sequence number 12, which is directly connected to you 
# (4325), 4718 and 1483 at the distances specified.
18  L  4214  12  <4325, 6>  <4718, 5>  <1483, 9>


# Here is an LSP from a node you've never heard of before (4109) with sequence
# number 78.
29  L  4109  78  <4718, 3>  <1483, 2>  

# You are hereby requested to forward a packet to 4109.
35  F  4109

36  F  1483


# The three types of packets represented here completely specify the input you will 
# have to handle for unicast connections.
