a. for (int i = 5; i <= 15; i += 2) { 
       System.out.print(i + " ");
   }

b. for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
       for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--) { 
           System.out.println(i + " " + j);
       }
   }

a.
1. As always, execution begins with the main method.
2. The first line of main is executed, which declares the variable m and assigns it the value 5.
3. To prepare for the method call in the second line, the actual parameters are evaluated to give
	int n = mystery(15, 4) + 2;

4. The method call is made and the actual parameters replace the formal parameters of the method.
5. The method's first line is executed so it evaluates to:
	a = 15 + 4;
6. The variable a is now assigned the value 19.
7. The second line of the method is evaluated to:
	return 2 * 19;
8. The method returns a value of 38 so line 2 of the main method continues evaluating:
	int n = 38 + 2;
9. The variable n is assigned the value 40.
10. The 3rd line of the main method is evaluated to:
	System.out.println(5 + " " + 40);
11. The String is printed out to the console.

b. public static int sumPositiveInts(int n) {
       int sum = 0;
       for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
           sum += i;
       }
       return sum;
   }

c. sum = sumPositiveInts(20);
