Matthew starts the game on his Windows machine and is presented with a window with an IP address and a "Connect" button. He types in his friend Sharon's IP address and clicks connect. Matthew's friend receives the invitation (with his open client on his Mac laptop) and accepts it. The screen now shows a checkerboard with an adjacent IM window. He customizes his font and greets his friend via IM. The game has randomly chosen who goes first. The starting player clicks on a piece to select it, then clicks on a spot to move the piece. The two go back and forth until the game ends. Both players are now shown 2 buttons for "New Game?" or "Quit". Matthew says goodbye to his friend via the IM window and clicks the "Quit" button. Sharon is directed to the home screen again where she can either send a game request to someone else or wait for one.
