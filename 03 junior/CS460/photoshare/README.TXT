=============
NOTES
=============

- Tags and comments cannot be deleted (it wasn't specified in the assignment).

- The database connection constants (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME) are
 defined in /include/global.inc.php so these must be edited prior to website use.

- The "You-may-also-like" functionality includes the own user's photos (assignment is vague).
