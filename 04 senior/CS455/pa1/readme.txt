NOTES
============
I'm not sure if it's my program or the receiver, but the performance seems poor because a 50KB file takes over a minute to transfer, but I think I completed requirements.

COMPILATION
============
$ javac *.java

EXECUTION
============
$ java SendApp <dest hostname> <dest port> <src port> <input fileName>
