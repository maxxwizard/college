Compilation

Run 'make' at the terminal.

"Bugs"
============
- If the -l flag is specified, the finds program only works with absolute pathnames  (so the argument to -p must start with '/').
- I did not finish the regular expression method so wildcard matching does not work. However, I do check that the argument to -s is regex valid.
- Program is inefficient (giant sized strings instead of malloc'ing).
